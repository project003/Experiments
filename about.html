        This is more than just a quote. At the G H Raisoni Institute of Engineering and Management, 
        this is the essence of our education system.<br><br>

        The institute is affiliated to the North Maharashtra University, Jalgaon. It is approved by 
        the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). It continues to be the contemporary and 
        sophisticated premier technical education institute. It provides knowledge pertaining to the 
        professional education.<br><br>

        We are well aware of the fact that higher education is available only to a small number of Indian
        youth. The Engineering institutions are the place where talents are groomed, students are nurtured, 
        competencies are developed and the architects of tomorrow are built. This is the acumen that in the 
        G H Raisoni Institute of Engineering and Management, quality is reflected in its very endeavor.
        Undoubtedly, the growth rate in here reciprocates our enhancing perfection.<br><br>
